# ✅ Task T003 Complete: Playwright + Cucumber Configuration

## 🎭 **Playwright Browser Automation Successfully Configured**

### **What Was Implemented:**

1. **✅ Playwright Installation & Setup**
   - Installed `@playwright/test` and `playwright` packages
   - Downloaded browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
   - Created comprehensive `playwright.config.ts`

2. **✅ Cucumber Integration**  
   - Enhanced `cucumber.js` configuration for Playwright compatibility
   - Added JSON and HTML reporting
   - Configured timeouts and retry logic

3. **✅ Playwright World (Support)**
   - Created `tests/step-definitions/support/world.ts` with browser management
   - Function-based World constructor for ES module compatibility
   - Support for multiple browsers (chromium, firefox, webkit)
   - Debug mode with slow motion and console logging

4. **✅ Cucumber Hooks**
   - Created `tests/step-definitions/support/hooks.ts` for lifecycle management
   - Screenshot capture on test failures
   - Automatic browser cleanup after scenarios
   - Report generation and debugging artifacts

5. **✅ NPM Scripts Added**
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e           # Run Cucumber tests with Playwright
   npm run test:e2e:headless  # Headless mode (default)
   npm run test:e2e:headed    # With browser UI for debugging
   npm run test:e2e:debug     # Debug mode with slow motion
   npm run playwright:codegen # Record new test interactions
   npm run playwright:report  # View detailed test reports
   ```

6. **✅ Cross-Browser Support**
   - Chromium (Chrome) - default
   - Firefox 
   - WebKit (Safari)
   - Mobile viewports (Pixel 5, iPhone 12, iPad Pro)

### **Test Results:**
- ✅ **32 scenarios detected** from Cucumber feature files
- ✅ **219 steps found** and correctly parsed  
- ✅ **Playwright World initialized** successfully
- ✅ **Browser hooks working** (Before/After scenario management)
- ✅ **Expected "undefined" steps** - these need implementation in future tasks

### **Environment Variables Supported:**
```bash
# Browser selection
BROWSER=chromium|firefox|webkit

# Debug modes  
HEADED=true          # Show browser UI
DEBUG=true           # Slow motion + console logging

# Base URL
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### **Key Features Ready:**
- 🎯 **Multi-browser testing** across Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- 📸 **Screenshot capture** on test failures  
- 🎬 **Video recording** for CI/CD environments
- 🔍 **Debug mode** with slow motion and console logging
- 📊 **Comprehensive reporting** (HTML + JSON)
- 🚀 **CI/CD ready** with headless execution
- 📱 **Mobile testing** with device emulation

## **Next Steps:**
The Playwright + Cucumber foundation is now complete! This enables:

- **T010-T012**: Creating Cucumber feature files ✅ (already exist)
- **T013-T017**: Writing Playwright step definitions (next tasks)
- **T048-T053**: Advanced testing (performance, accessibility, visual regression)
