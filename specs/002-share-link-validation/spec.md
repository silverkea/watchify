# Feature Specification: Share Link Validation with HMAC Signature

**Feature Branch**: `002-share-link-validation`  
**Created**: October 31, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "share link validation - i want to update the share link to be able to validate that it was generated by this application, so I want the share link to have an additional parameter that is a signature generated with a hmac sha256 signature of the share link parameter"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature: Add cryptographic validation to share links
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: users sharing and receiving links, application
   → Actions: generate secure links, validate link authenticity
   → Data: share link parameters, HMAC SHA256 signature
   → Constraints: links must be verifiable as app-generated
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Secret key management and rotation strategy]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Link expiration behavior with signatures]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary: Generate and validate signed share links
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement focused on signature generation and validation
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Share Link, Signature, Validation Result
7. Run Review Checklist
   → WARN "Spec has uncertainties around key management"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-31
- Q: What should happen when someone accesses an old share link without a signature? → A: No backward compatibility needed (app not live yet)
- Q: Where should the secret key for HMAC signature generation be stored? → A: Environment variable only accessible from the server
- Q: What specific user experience should be provided for invalid signatures? → A: Silent redirect (no error message, just go to home page)
- Q: Which specific data should be included in the signature calculation? → A: All URL parameters (watch party ID, movie ID, etc.)
- Q: Should signature validation be performed on the client-side or server-side? → A: Server-side only (signature validation happens on page load)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
When a user creates a watch party and generates a share link, the application automatically adds a cryptographic signature to ensure the link is authentic. When someone clicks the link, the application validates the signature before allowing access to the watch party.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user creates a watch party, **When** they generate a share link, **Then** the link includes a cryptographic signature parameter that validates the link was created by this application
2. **Given** a user receives a valid signed share link, **When** they click it, **Then** the application validates the signature and grants access to the watch party
3. **Given** a user receives a tampered or forged share link, **When** they click it, **Then** the application detects the invalid signature and redirects to the home page
4. **Given** a user receives a share link with missing signature, **When** they click it, **Then** the application treats it as invalid and redirects to the home page

### Edge Cases
- What happens when someone manually modifies the share link parameters?
- How does the system handle links that have valid signatures but corrupted data?
- What happens if the same share link is accessed multiple times?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate an HMAC SHA256 signature for every share link using all URL parameters (watch party ID, movie ID, etc.) as input
- **FR-002**: System MUST append the signature as an additional parameter to all generated share links
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate the signature of incoming share links server-side before granting access
- **FR-004**: System MUST silently redirect to home page for share links with invalid, missing, or tampered signatures (no error message displayed)
- **FR-005**: System MUST use a server-side environment variable to store the secret key for signature generation and validation
- **FR-006**: System MUST reject all share links without valid signatures (no backward compatibility required)

### Key Entities
- **Share Link**: Contains watch party parameters and cryptographic signature for authenticity verification
- **Signature**: HMAC SHA256 hash computed from link parameters using application secret key
- **Validation Result**: Boolean outcome of signature verification with optional error details
