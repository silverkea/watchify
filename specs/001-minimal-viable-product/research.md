# Research: Movie Watch Party Platform MVP

**Date**: 2025-09-30  
**Feature**: 001-minimal-viable-product

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Framework: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
**Decision**: Next.js 14 with App Router and TypeScript  
**Rationale**: 
- Server-side rendering capabilities for better SEO and performance
- Built-in API routes for secure backend operations
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Automatic code splitting and optimization
- Perfect integration with Vercel deployment

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Vite + React: Less built-in functionality, would need separate backend
- Create React App: Deprecated, static-only deployment limitations
- Vanilla React: Too much configuration overhead

### UI Framework: Tailwind CSS + ShadCN/UI
**Decision**: Tailwind CSS for styling with ShadCN/UI component library  
**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach aligns with atomic design principles
- Excellent dark/light theme support
- ShadCN provides accessible, customizable components
- Tree-shaking reduces bundle size
- Consistent design system

**Alternatives considered**:
- Material-UI: Heavier bundle, less customizable
- Chakra UI: Less modern, smaller community
- Styled Components: Performance overhead, larger bundles

### Movie Data API: TMDB (The Movie Database)
**Decision**: TMDB API as primary data source  
**Rationale**:
- Comprehensive movie database with high-quality images
- Free tier: 40 requests per 10 seconds (sufficient for MVP)
- Well-documented REST API
- Rich metadata (synopsis, cast, genres, ratings)
- Reliable uptime and performance

**Alternatives considered**:
- OMDB: More limited data, lower rate limits
- IMDb API: Not officially available, licensing issues
- Local database: Too much overhead for MVP

### State Management: React Context + Local Storage
**Decision**: React Context for global state, localStorage for persistence  
**Rationale**:
- Simple state needs don't require complex solutions
- Theme preferences persist across sessions
- Built-in React features, no additional dependencies
- Easy to test and maintain

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux Toolkit: Overkill for MVP scope
- Zustand: Additional dependency not needed
- React Query: May add later for API caching

### Testing Strategy: Jest + Cucumber
**Decision**: Jest for unit tests, Cucumber with TypeScript for E2E  
**Rationale**:
- Jest integrates seamlessly with Next.js
- Cucumber provides business-readable test scenarios
- TypeScript support for both testing frameworks
- Aligns with TDD constitutional requirement

**Alternatives considered**:
- Cypress: More complex setup, heavier resource usage
- Playwright: Newer, less ecosystem support
- Vitest: Good but Jest is more established with Next.js

### Deployment: Vercel
**Decision**: Vercel platform for hosting  
**Rationale**:
- Created by Next.js team, optimal integration
- Serverless functions for API routes
- Automatic deployments from Git
- Built-in environment variable management
- Free tier sufficient for MVP

**Alternatives considered**:
- Netlify: Good but less Next.js optimization
- AWS: Too complex for MVP
- GitHub Pages: No server-side capabilities

## Architecture Patterns

### Folder-by-Feature Structure
```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── movie-search/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── types/
│   │   └── __tests__/
│   ├── movie-details/
│   └── watch-party/
├── components/
│   ├── atoms/
│   ├── molecules/
│   └── organisms/
├── lib/
└── types/
```

### API Route Structure
```
pages/api/
├── movies/
│   ├── search.ts
│   └── [id].ts
└── watch-party/
    ├── create.ts
    └── [id].ts
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Image Optimization
- Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
- WebP format with fallbacks
- Lazy loading for movie posters
- Responsive image sizing

### Bundle Optimization
- Tailwind CSS purging for smaller stylesheets
- Dynamic imports for large components
- Tree-shaking with ES modules
- Webpack bundle analyzer for monitoring

### API Caching Strategy
- Server-side caching of TMDB responses
- Browser caching with appropriate headers
- Local storage for frequently accessed data
- Debounced search requests

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management
- Environment variables for all secrets
- `.env.local` for development (git-ignored)
- Vercel environment variables for production
- No client-side exposure of API keys

### Data Validation
- Zod schemas for API request/response validation
- Input sanitization for user-generated content
- CORS configuration for API routes
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

## Development Workflow

### Environment Setup
- Node.js 18+ requirement
- pnpm for package management
- VS Code with recommended extensions
- Git hooks for code quality

### Code Quality
- ESLint + Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for pre-commit hooks
- TypeScript strict mode
- Path aliases for clean imports

## Integration Points

### External Dependencies
- TMDB API: Movie data fetching
- Vercel KV: Watch party data storage
- Browser APIs: Timezone detection, clipboard access
- localStorage: Theme and user preferences

### Internal Dependencies
- Theme system: Dark/light mode switching
- Timer system: Countdown synchronization
- URL encoding: Base64 watch party data
- Responsive design: Mobile-first approach

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- TMDB API rate limiting: Mitigated by caching and request optimization
- Timezone synchronization complexity: Use browser APIs and UTC timestamps
- Large bundle size: Mitigated by code splitting and tree-shaking
- SEO for dynamic content: Solved by server-side rendering

### Operational Risks
- Vercel free tier limits: Monitor usage, upgrade if needed
- API key exposure: Strict environment variable usage
- Browser compatibility: Target modern browsers (ES2020+)
- Mobile performance: Responsive design and optimization

## Next Steps

1. Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Configure Tailwind CSS and ShadCN/UI
3. Implement basic routing structure
4. Set up testing framework (Jest + Cucumber)
5. Create initial component library structure
6. Configure environment variables and API integration
