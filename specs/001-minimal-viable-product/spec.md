# Feature Specification: Movie Watch Party Platform MVP

**Feature Branch**: `001-minimal-viable-product`  
**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "minimal viable product. the user should be to search for movies and see movies presented in a grid. key info about the movie like title, release date, star rating should be displayed together with an image of the movie poster. the user should also be able to filter by genre. when the user selects a movie, more a the details of that movie should be displayed with additional details including synopsis, and main actors. on the detail view there should be option to schedule a watch party with date and time options that are easy to use. once date and time have been selected, there should be shedule button that displays a watch party landing page with a countdown timer displayed promenently at the top. the landing page should also display all the details of the movie from the detail view below the countdown. when the countdown time reaches zero, it should be replaced with a message to say 'Start Watching'. there should be a copy link button below the countdown timer. when the user clicks the copy link button this should create a url with a base64 encoded payload in the querystring which will allow linking back to the landing page with the correct movie details displayed and also countdown timer. The display of countdown timer should be working globally, so the countdown timer should be in the users local timezone based on their browser"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user wants to discover movies, select one they're interested in, and coordinate a synchronized watch party with friends or family at a specific date and time.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user is on the home page, **When** they search for "action movies", **Then** they see a grid of action movies with posters, titles, release dates, and star ratings
2. **Given** the user sees the movie grid, **When** they apply a genre filter, **Then** the grid updates to show only movies from that genre
3. **Given** the user clicks on a movie from the grid, **When** the movie detail page loads, **Then** they see expanded information including synopsis and main actors
4. **Given** the user is on a movie detail page, **When** they select a date and time for a watch party, **Then** they can create a watch party with those details
5. **Given** the user has scheduled a watch party, **When** they access the watch party landing page, **Then** they see a countdown timer and all movie details
6. **Given** the countdown timer reaches zero, **When** the time expires, **Then** the timer is replaced with "Start Watching" message
7. **Given** the user is on a watch party landing page, **When** they click the "Copy Link" button, **Then** a shareable URL is copied to their clipboard
8. **Given** someone opens a shared watch party URL, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see the same movie details and countdown timer in their local timezone

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no movies match the search criteria?
- How does the system handle invalid date/time selections for watch parties?
- What occurs if the user tries to schedule a watch party for a past date?
- How does the system behave when movie data (poster, details) is unavailable?
- What happens when someone accesses a watch party URL with corrupted base64 data?
- How does the system handle users in different timezones accessing the same watch party?
